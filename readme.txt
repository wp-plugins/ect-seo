== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can I use this plug-in with any shopping cart software or WordPress site? =

NO, this plug-in can only be used with [Ecommerce Templates shopping cart software](http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/wordpress-ecommerce.asp) using the WordPress integration.

= Will this work for non-store pages? =

Non-store pages will use the regular set up for titles and meta descriptions.

= Why can't I enter my own title for the products, detail and categories pages? =

These pages are dynamic and created from the database. As such the meta content and title is taken from elements such as the product name, description, id and section.
